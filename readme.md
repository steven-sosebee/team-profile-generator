# Team Profile Generator

## Description

I took on this project to enable other users to quickly generate a professional-looking web page for their teams without much coding experience.

Not all managers or entrepreneurs have the web development skills to build out a custom team page.  This app helps to automate some of that work.

## Installation

To install the application download nodejs and npm inquirer.  Once the repository is cloned, run the command 'node index.js' from inside the folder.

## Usage

Once theh application is called, the command line interface will begin asking questions.  Start by adding details about the team, then information about the manager.  Finally, the user can loop through as many team members as is needed.
